Workers Attendance System

Expecting a mobile app installed on every workers/supervisors/project manager.
Admin/Managers/Supervisors/workers will use the app for their every day attendance
Everyday evening Project managers/supervisors will update to office admin for tomorrow’s workers task assigned and admin will send notifications to workers regarding their work site and fleet to follow (use company transport or public transport)

Admin assign tasks to the drivers about their tomorrow’s site transport arrangement along with the number of workers they need to pick up from the dormitory. This will get reflected in the driver’s mobile through their app. 
For each drop drivers need to update through the app installed in their mobile - task completed or not
Every day tasks must be updated through the app.



Through the app 
Managers will give instructions to the supervisors and workers
Supervisors will report everyday work progress – monitor worker attendance
Workers will use the app to submit their attendance – 
Morning – Login before 8 am and Logout – 12 Noon 
Lunch Break 1 Hour
Afternoon – Login 1 PM and logout – 5 PM/7 PM – may be extended if over time required in the site
For every project – Geo location will be allocated, when the worker within the Geo location, then only they will be able to submit their attendance. Outside of location, they will not be able to submit Attendance.
If any worker moves out of the Geo location, immediately notified to the supervisor/office admin. If project manager wants to move worker to other sites, he needs to notify to the management.

Through the app, managers/supervisors/workers will raise the request for materials/tools/leave/medical reimbursement/advance payment/resignations/terminations/warnings for uninformed leave-misconduct

Approval can be done through App or Portal

Roles/Permissions for each manager/supervisor/admin
